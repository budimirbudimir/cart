# ELEMENT FE Test: Budimir Budimir

## Tools

- Bootstrapped the app using Create React App with `--redux` template flag
- ESLint and TS I added on top
- Used React and Redux Toolkit for UI/store

## Commands

I used Yarn, so commands are aligned to it, for NPM, replace `yarn` with `npm`.

- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to run app locally
- `yarn lint && yarn test` to run ESLint and Jest
- `yarn build` to build production bundle

## Notes

- Got a bit lost in the tooling, missed out on adding some more tests
- Naming could be better, ex. Total could become Cart, etc.
- Been a while since I wrote React, in the last 6 months it was almost exclusively VanillaJS
- I could have added dedicated reducer action for toggling the selection, would separate concerns nicer
- I could have added mocked call in order to obtain parameters asynchronously
- I could have dedicated some more time to styles maybe, this is barely acceptable in my own opinion :)
